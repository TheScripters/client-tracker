# client-tracker

This is an application for tracking customers, clients, accounts, etc. written in PHP using the Pear::MDB2 abstraction layer.

It's currently classified as pre-alpha because it's still in the process of being written the first time and is largely non-functioning (as many functions for it have not yet been written).

Anyone interested in assisting is fully welcome to apply.

## Features

* Client login for invoices
* PayPal integration (planned)
* Track other account details (planned)
